# LOOK: 
# opendatasets, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, ordered-set, gensim, nltk, jupyter, numba, dask, scikit-optimize, scikit-surprise
# make sure (numpy==1.23.5)
# not sure if dask or "dask[complete]"
# numpy version downgraded to verison 1.23.5 to support usage of np.int in built in functions...
# https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/issues/1280
# avoids having ot use (np.int = int)


LOOK: packages to install, remember to do a runtime check:
numpy==1.23.5, jupyter, opendatasets, pandas, spacy, ordered-set,
scikit-learn, numba, dask, scikit-optimize, dask\[distributed\]


LOOK: Should go through this process by removng the env and then reinstalling it

LOOK: Need to re-do the above steps in a fresh notebook

LOOK: Does the fact that svd, train, and test user can be used more than once introduce problems???
Not really when they are chosen randomly and there is a large selection.

LOOK: Does the fact that the same set of svd users are used for testing and training introduce problems???

Suppose you want to give a rating to a completely new user. 
you find feature 1 and feature 2
with feature 3 you use a sample of the same collection of svd users used in training from the database
and a sample of the train/test users used in training from the database

In the training of the model the same set of svd users are used for testing and training
